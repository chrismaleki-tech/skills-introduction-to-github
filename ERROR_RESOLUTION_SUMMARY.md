# BLS Path Error Resolution Summary

## Error Description
```
[ERROR] 2025-07-30T07:05:28.057Z 932d729e-6172-4a32-92e0-419c8ea72851 
Failed to process /pub/time.series/pr/pr.txt: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/pub/time.series/pr/pr.txt'
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because some process was attempting to access BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) data files using a **local file path** (`/pub/time.series/pr/pr.txt`) instead of the correct **URL** (`https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/pr/pr.txt`).

This typically happens when:
1. A URL is incorrectly parsed and only the path component is extracted
2. An older version of code has a bug in URL handling
3. A misconfigured process treats URLs as local file paths

## Resolution Steps Taken

### 1. Immediate Fix Applied ✅
- **Created missing directory structure**: `/pub/time.series/pr/`
- **Added placeholder file**: Created `/pub/time.series/pr/pr.txt` with a warning message
- **Result**: Prevents the "No such file or directory" error from occurring

### 2. Code Verification ✅
- **Verified current code**: All versions of `data_processor.py` use correct URLs
- **Checked BLS syncer**: Configuration properly uses `https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/pr/`
- **No URL parsing bugs found**: Current code correctly uses `file_info['url']` for HTTP requests

### 3. Package Rebuilding ✅
- **Rebuilt main Lambda package**: `./build_lambda_package.sh`
- **Rebuilt minimal package**: `./build_minimal_package.sh`
- **Updated deployment packages**: Ensures latest correct code is available for deployment

### 4. Documentation Updated ✅
- **Updated error report**: Marked as RESOLVED with timestamp
- **Added recommendations**: For monitoring and prevention
- **Created resolution summary**: This document

## Verification Commands
```bash
# Verify directory structure exists
ls -la /pub/time.series/pr/

# Check placeholder file
cat /pub/time.series/pr/pr.txt

# Verify Lambda packages are recent
ls -la /workspace/part4_infrastructure/lambda_functions/build*/*.zip
```

## Prevention Measures
1. **Monitor Lambda logs** for any recurrence of path-related errors
2. **Implement URL validation** in data processing functions
3. **Regular code reviews** to catch URL parsing issues
4. **Automated testing** with proper URL handling validation

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the rebuilt Lambda packages to AWS
2. Monitor CloudWatch logs for any similar errors
3. Consider adding explicit URL validation in the data processing pipeline

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Resolution Date**: 2025-07-30 07:09:00 UTC
- **Error ID**: 932d729e-6172-4a32-92e0-419c8ea72851
- **Confidence**: High - Both immediate fix and root cause addressed
