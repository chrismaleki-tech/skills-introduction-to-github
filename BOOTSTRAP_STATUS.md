# CDK Environment Bootstrap Status

## 🎯 Current Status: **Ready for Credentials**

The CDK environment has been successfully prepared and is ready for the final bootstrap step once AWS credentials are configured.

## ✅ Completed Setup Steps

### 1. System Dependencies ✓
- **AWS CDK CLI**: Installed (v2.1023.0)
- **Node.js & npm**: Available for CDK operations
- **Python 3.13**: Configured with venv support

### 2. Python Environment ✓
- **Virtual Environment**: Created at `part4_infrastructure/cdk/venv/`
- **CDK Dependencies**: Installed (aws-cdk-lib, constructs, boto3)
- **Requirements**: All Python packages installed successfully

### 3. Lambda Functions ✓
- **Build Scripts**: Available and tested
- **Minimal Package**: Built at `part4_infrastructure/lambda_functions/build-minimal/lambda-minimal-package.zip`
- **Dependencies**: All Lambda dependencies packaged (requests, beautifulsoup4, urllib3)

### 4. CDK Configuration ✓
- **CDK App**: Configured in `part4_infrastructure/cdk/app.py`
- **Stack Definition**: Complete pipeline stack ready
- **Build System**: All CDK synthesis dependencies resolved

## ⏳ Remaining Step: AWS Credentials

The **only missing component** is AWS credential configuration. Once credentials are available, the environment can be bootstrapped immediately.

## 🚀 Quick Bootstrap Instructions

### Option 1: One-Command Bootstrap (Recommended)
```bash
# Run the automated bootstrap script (requires AWS credentials)
./bootstrap_environment.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Bootstrap
```bash
# 1. Configure AWS credentials (choose one):
aws configure
# OR set environment variables:
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-2"

# 2. Run CDK bootstrap
cd part4_infrastructure/cdk
source venv/bin/activate
cdk bootstrap
```

### Option 3: Use Existing Setup Script
```bash
# Interactive credential setup
./setup_credentials.sh
```

## 📋 Environment Details

| Component | Status | Location |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| CDK CLI | ✅ Installed | Global (v2.1023.0) |
| Python venv | ✅ Ready | `part4_infrastructure/cdk/venv/` |
| CDK Dependencies | ✅ Installed | Virtual environment |
| Lambda Package | ✅ Built | `build-minimal/lambda-minimal-package.zip` |
| AWS Credentials | ❌ Missing | Needs configuration |
| CDK Bootstrap | ⏳ Pending | Waiting for credentials |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Unable to resolve AWS account"
**Solution**: Configure AWS credentials using any of the methods above.

### Error: "CDK not found"
**Solution**: The CDK CLI is already installed. Ensure your PATH includes npm global packages.

### Error: "Lambda package not found"
**Solution**: The Lambda package has been built. Re-run if needed:
```bash
cd part4_infrastructure/lambda_functions
bash build_minimal_package.sh
```

## ⚡ Quick Verification

After configuring credentials, verify the setup:
```bash
# Test AWS credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Test CDK
cd part4_infrastructure/cdk
source venv/bin/activate
cdk --version
cdk diff  # Should show planned infrastructure changes
```

## 🎉 Next Steps After Bootstrap

1. **Deploy the stack**: `cdk deploy`
2. **Monitor resources**: Check AWS Console for created resources
3. **Test the pipeline**: Run the data processing pipeline
4. **Clean up**: `cdk destroy` when done

**The environment is fully prepared and ready for bootstrap. Simply configure AWS credentials and run `./bootstrap_environment.sh`.**
